## üöÄ Installation Guide

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- .NET Framework 4.8+
- DirectX 11 compatible GPU
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)

### Download Instructions
1. Locate the download link in the About section
2. Save `launcher.exe` to your preferred directory
3. Run as Administrator for full functionality
4. Follow the on-screen configuration wizard

### First-Time Setup
```bash
1. Disable antivirus temporarily (false positive prevention)
2. Ensure Roblox is fully closed
3. Run launcher.exe
4. Authenticate via built-in verification system
5. Select your injection preferences
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Performance Settings
| Option | Recommended | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Injection Mode | Manual | Prevents detection by anticheat systems |
| Script Cache | Enabled | 30% faster script loading |
| Memory Safety | Level 2 | Optimal performance/security balance |

### Customization Options
```lua
-- Sample configuration snippet
EclipseX.Config({
    theme = "midnight_purple",
    auto_update = true,
    script_verification = "strict",
    hotkeys = {
        execute = "F5",
        menu = "INSERT"
    }
})
```

## üìö Script Development

### API Reference
```lua
-- Core Functions
EclipseX.Execute(script) -- Runs Lua code
EclipseX.MemoryRead(address, type) -- Reads game memory
EclipseX.HookFunction(name, callback) -- Creates function hook

-- Utility Functions
EclipseX.GetPlayers() -- Returns player table
EclipseX.GetCharacter(userId) -- Returns character model
EclipseX.GetGameInfo() -- Returns game metadata
```

### Example Script
```lua
-- God Mode Script
local player = EclipseX.GetLocalPlayer()
local character = EclipseX.GetCharacter(player)

EclipseX.HookFunction("TakeDamage", function()
    return nil -- Block all damage
end)

EclipseX.Notify("God Mode activated for " .. player.Name)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Anti-Detection

### Protection Matrix
| Technique | Status | Effectiveness |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Memory Obfuscation | Active | 98% |
| Signature Spoofing | Active | 95% |
